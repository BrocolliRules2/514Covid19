  <h1>Covid- 19!</h1>
  <p>The purpose of this app is to help you gain more knowledge on which states in North America are more prone to COVID 19</p>

<h4> COVID 19 Background </h4>
<p> The actual name of the virus is “SARS-CoV-2” </br>
The disease it causes has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (Abbreviated “COVID-19”). <br></br>

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people, such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus, SARS-CoV-2.
<br></br>
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All 3 of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
<br></br>
Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to cause severe illness in people. The complete clinical picture with regard to COVID-19 is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, a report out of China suggests serious illness occurs in 16% of cases. Older people and people with compromised immune systems and certain underlying health conditions - such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, to name a few - seem to be at greater risk of serious illness.
